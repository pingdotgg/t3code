# Codex

For one account, use the default Codex provider with your normal Codex login.
[Provider setup](./install.md#providers) covers installation, Settings > Providers,
and custom binaries or environment variables.

## Use multiple accounts

A shared Codex home with a shadow home lets work and personal accounts continue
the same threads. The accounts share Codex sessions and configuration while keeping
their own login and available models.

Keep your first account in `~/.codex`. On the environment's machine, sign the
second account into a fresh directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex_personal
CODEX_HOME=~/.codex_personal codex login
```

Then add a second Codex instance in **Settings > Providers**:

| Instance       | CODEX_HOME path | Shadow home path    |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| Codex Work     | `~/.codex`      | Leave empty         |
| Codex Personal | `~/.codex`      | `~/.codex_personal` |

Both instances must use the same **CODEX_HOME path**. T3 Code prepares the shared
state in the shadow directory; do not populate it by copying your whole Codex
home.

The shadow account needs its own `auth.json` file. If Codex uses an OS credential
store, configure file storage for this setup. See
[OpenAI's credential storage guide](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/auth#credential-storage).

Use a completely separate **CODEX_HOME path**, with no shadow home, when you want
separate Codex sessions and configuration. That instance cannot continue threads
from the other home.

## Switch accounts in an existing thread

Choose the other account from the thread's model picker. T3 Code offers compatible
Codex instances that share the thread's **CODEX_HOME path**. Changing accounts does
not move the conversation into a separate Codex home.

If the account is missing from the picker, compare the home paths in provider
settings. If two instances show the same unexpected account or models, check their
reported accounts, refresh provider status, and confirm the second instance has
its own shadow path and login. A shadow-home conflict usually means the directory
contains a copied Codex setup. Use a fresh shadow directory and sign in again.

## Answer questions while Codex works

Codex can ask a question and keep working. Answer it in the thread's question
panel. The answer becomes a new message: it reaches the active turn, or starts
another turn if Codex has finished. Unanswered questions survive reconnects.
This requires a Codex version that supports async questions.

## Approve app access

Codex tools can request access to another app. Respond to the named app's request
in the thread on web, desktop, or mobile. Some tools offer access for one request,
the current session, or permanently. See [Permission modes](./permission-modes.md)
for command and file approvals.

## Send feedback to OpenAI

In an existing Codex thread, send `/feedback` with an optional description, for
example `/feedback The agent stopped before finishing the tests`. This uploads
the conversation and Codex logs to OpenAI. The returned thread ID can be shared
with OpenAI support.
