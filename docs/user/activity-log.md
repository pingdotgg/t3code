# Activity log

On web and desktop, consecutive tool calls appear as an expandable summary. Open it to inspect
commands, tool inputs, status, and exit codes. Expand a tool call to see its output. A running
command's output updates live, and long output shows only its most recent part. Use **Open diff** on
a file change to review its contents.

A finished turn folds its work behind **Worked for**. **Settings → Chat → Transcript view** changes
that: **Thinking** opens every turn, tool group, and superseded attempt, and **Verbose** also opens
each row's thinking text and tool output. On web and desktop you can also switch it from a thread's
menu under **Transcript view**, and mobile has the same choice under **Settings → Chat**. Select any
header or row to fold it again.

T3 Orchestrator summaries describe the actions taken, such as **Ran 2 commands and sent messages
to 3 threads**. Repeated messages to the same destinations show both counts: **Sent 5 messages to
2 threads**. Thread creation counts the threads returned by the tool, including batches.

Groups with many kinds of activity show up to two specific action categories and a count of the
remaining actions. Commands, file changes, and orchestration changes take priority over reads and
status checks. Expand the group for the full list.

Failed calls do not count as successful messages or creations. Waiting on a thread does not mean
it finished, and an interrupt or cancellation request does not mean the thread stopped. When tool
details are unavailable, summaries use a broader description instead of guessing how many threads
were affected.
