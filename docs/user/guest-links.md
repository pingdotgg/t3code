# Guest links

A guest link lets a teammate follow one thread in their browser and ask the agent questions, with no
account. They see your messages and the agent's replies as they stream. Each message they send waits
until you send or dismiss it.

## Share a thread

Guest links are a beta. Turn on **Settings → Labs → Guest links** for the machine that runs the
thread. They also need [T3 Connect](./remote-access.md): sign in and link that machine, because the
link points at its T3 Connect address. The machine must stay online while the guest uses it.
While the setting is off, every guest link on that machine stops working; links that have not
expired work again when you turn it back on.

1. Right-click the thread in the sidebar and choose **Share with guest**. It is also in the thread
   menu and the command palette.
2. Copy the link and send it to one person. It works in one browser and expires after 24 hours.
   Opening it again in that browser takes them back to the thread.
3. When they send a message, it appears at the end of the thread and the sidebar shows **Request**.
   Choose **Send** to run it as a normal turn, or **Dismiss**. Files they attached show with the
   message, and **Send** includes them.

Choose **Stop sharing** to end the link at once. Archiving the thread, creating a new link, or
unlinking the machine from T3 Connect also ends it. You can send or dismiss guest messages from the mobile app.

## What the guest sees

The guest sees the thread's recent history and everything after, in the same timeline you see, as
it streams: messages and their files, the agent's replies and reasoning, plans, questions, and its
work, with command output when they expand a command. Their composer shows the thread's model, but
they cannot change it. They do not see diffs, and they cannot act on the thread: no forking,
reverting, opening files on your machine, or answering the agent for you.

Anything the agent read or printed can show, such as a value from a file. Share only threads you
are comfortable showing.

## Guest attachments

Guests can attach images and other files to a message: use the paperclip, paste, or drop them on
the message box. A message holds up to 4 files and 10 MB in total. Images must be PNG, JPEG, GIF, or
WebP. While messages wait for you, their files can total 20 MB; the guest can attach more once you
send or dismiss some.

Dismissing a message, ending the link, or archiving the thread deletes the files of messages that
still wait. A sent message keeps its files, like any message in the thread.

The guest's text and files run with the thread's current permission mode once you send them. Check
them before you choose **Send**, as you would anything pasted from a chat.
