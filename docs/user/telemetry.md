# Product usage data

The T3 Code server sends product usage events to PostHog, associated with a hashed account or
installation identifier. Events include the provider, model, reasoning effort, permission mode,
turn result, duration, and main-agent token totals when available.

Events do not include prompts, responses, file contents, authentication tokens, conversation IDs,
raw provider events, or child-agent output. Child-agent token use is excluded from the totals.

To disable collection, set `T3CODE_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false` in the server's environment before
starting it. This stops product events from being recorded or sent.

## Export diagnostics to your own receiver

To send traces, metrics, or logs to an OpenTelemetry receiver, open
**Settings > General > Diagnostics**, select an environment, and enter each signal's OTLP HTTP
endpoint under **OpenTelemetry export** (for example `http://localhost:4318/v1/traces`). Save, then
restart that environment's server. The receiver must be reachable from the server's machine.

`T3CODE_OTLP_*_URL` and standard `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*` environment variables override the saved
settings. Set `T3CODE_OTLP_HEADERS` for receivers that need authentication, and
`T3CODE_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf` for receivers that do not accept JSON.
