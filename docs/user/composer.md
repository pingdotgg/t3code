# Message composer

Messages can contain up to 120,000 characters. If a draft is longer, T3 Code keeps it in the
composer and shows how many characters need to be removed. Shorten the draft or split it into
multiple messages, then send again in the same thread.

On servers that support direct uploads, images upload as soon as you add them. The send button
becomes available after every upload finishes. Failed uploads can be retried or removed.

## Commands and skills

Type `/` to open the command menu. Type `$` to find and add a skill. Skill rows show their source,
such as System, Personal, Project, or App.

By default, the `/` menu includes skills. To keep this menu command-only, turn off **Show skills in
slash menu** in **Settings → General**. Skill results use the `/skill:Skill Name` label and add the
same `$name` skill token to your message. The original skill name remains searchable. If the provider
also reports that skill as a native slash command, T3 Code hides the duplicate native entry and keeps
the `/skill:Skill Name` label.

On desktop, press `Cmd+Enter` on macOS or `Ctrl+Enter` on Windows and Linux from a new thread to
start it in the background. T3 Code opens another new thread and shows an **Open** action for the
thread that started. The new thread keeps the selected workspace mode and base branch. If **New
worktree** is selected, each background thread creates its own worktree.
