# Organizing threads

Pin a thread from its context menu to keep it in the pinned section above your active work.
Pinned threads are shown independently of their project, including when you connect to more than
one environment.

On web and desktop, hold and drag a thread to change its position within its section
(active inbox, snoozed shelf, settled history, or pinned block). There is no drag handle —
just press, hold briefly, and drag. On mobile, open a pinned thread's menu and choose **Move up**
or **Move down**. Pinned order is stored by the server and syncs across devices; other section
orders are saved locally in this client.

If reordering is unavailable for one environment, update the T3 Code server running in that
environment. Older servers can still pin and unpin threads, but do not understand synced ordering;
their pinned threads keep the default newest-first order below the ones you have arranged.

## Environment artwork

Dev and Nightly environments can identify themselves with artwork at the top of the sidebar and in
the send button. Choose **Artwork**, **Version pill**, or **None** in Settings under environment
identification. Artwork is recolored to match each built-in theme. Custom themes use the **Version
pill** fallback because their colors are not controlled by T3 Code.

To generate a fresh title from the conversation, open a thread's context menu and choose
**Regenerate title**. While T3 Code is generating it, the action reads **Regenerating…** and cannot
be selected again. The option is hidden when the connected environment needs a server update.
