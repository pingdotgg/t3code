# Usage and limits

## Understand your usage

**Usage** combines Codex, Claude Code, and Grok Build session history from your connected
environments. It shows token use, cache savings, model breakdowns, and estimated API-equivalent
cost. These estimates are not your subscription bill.

Totals depend on the history available on each server. Grok turns without a saved completed-turn
record are missing from the totals.

On web and desktop, use the environment dropdown to filter costs, tokens, and limits. All
environments are selected by default. The dropdown shows which environments are still scanning;
results appear as each one responds.

If recent work is missing or a new model shows no cost, refresh to rescan session history and
update model pricing.

## Set custom model prices

On web or desktop, open the environment dropdown on **Usage**, then choose **Model prices** to add,
edit, or reset a model's estimated price. **Apply to** starts with your current Usage filter;
choose all environments or select individual destinations. Enter the exact model ID and USD
rates per million input and output tokens. You can enter any model ID, including models
without public pricing.

Cache read and cache write rates are optional and use the input rate when blank. Enter `0` for
tokens that are free. Saved prices replace automatic pricing for all of that environment's
history and are shared with clients connected to it. When environments have different prices,
cells show **Mixed**. Edit rates directly in the table, then choose **Save changes** to apply all
edited rows. Untouched cells keep each environment's rate. Select one environment to inspect its
prices. **Reset to automatic** marks a model's override for removal when you save; you can undo
it before saving.

Each destination reports whether the change saved. Offline or unavailable environments are
marked **Not saved**. Reconnect them and choose **Retry failed saves** to finish the same change
without writing again to environments that already saved. Changes are not queued after you close
the dialog.

## Track subscription limits

**Usage → Limits** shows quota use and reset times for Codex and Claude subscriptions. It also
compares quota consumed with time elapsed in each window, so you can judge your pace before the
next reset.

If a window looks stale, refresh Limits to re-check every provider and hub.

API-key accounts may not report subscription limits. This also applies to Claude connections
using a proxy through `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`.

## Start after your subscription resets

On web and desktop, an exhausted provider remains in the model picker. When its reported
limits block the selected model, Send and its keyboard shortcut are disabled. Write your
message and choose **Start when available** to save it for that provider account.

The environment keeps the exact message, attachments, model options, and permission mode.
You can close the client or restart the environment while it waits. A waiting banner shows
the saved message; choose **Cancel queued message** to remove it. Archiving or settling the
thread also cancels the wait. Cancel the wait before snoozing a thread. Only one message
can wait per thread.

The environment starts the message after a fresh quota check confirms capacity. A displayed
reset time is an estimate, not a promise to start at that instant. The environment must be
running, and the selected account must still be enabled and signed in. It never switches
accounts automatically. If usage is unavailable, normal sending remains available and
automatic waiting is not offered.

Starting a new thread may prepare its workspace before saving the wait. The agent itself
does not start until capacity returns. These controls require an updated environment.

## Connect a CLIProxyAPI hub

To see pooled accounts, open **Settings → Providers → Usage providers → Add hub**. Choose the
environment that will connect to the hub and enter its URL and management key.

The accounts appear under **Usage → Limits**. This connection supplies usage information; configure
the provider separately to send agent requests through the hub. Remove the hub from the same
settings section when you no longer need it.
