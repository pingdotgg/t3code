# Customize a project icon

T3 Code selects a project icon automatically. It checks `t3.json`, common favicon and app icon
paths, and icon links in project HTML files.

To choose a different icon:

1. Open **Settings** and select **Projects**.
2. Select the project.
3. Under **Appearance**, select **Choose a project file**.
4. Search for an image file and select it.

T3 Code supports SVG, PNG, ICO, JPEG, GIF, AVIF, and WebP files. The selected path applies to
each checkout in the project group and appears on your connected clients.

To use automatic detection again, select **Automatic**.

## Keep the default branch current

Turn on **Automatically pull** in a project's settings to keep its default-branch checkout current.
T3 Code checks in the background and when the server starts. It uses the branch's configured
upstream and only performs a fast-forward pull when the checkout has no working-tree changes,
untracked files, or local commits.

The pull is skipped if the checkout is on another branch, has no upstream, or contains local work.
Pull failures do not prevent the server from starting.
