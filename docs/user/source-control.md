# Source control

T3 Code integrates with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Azure DevOps to clone and publish
repositories, create pull requests, and review changes.

## Connect an account

Install Git and configure authentication on the machine running your T3 Code server. For a remote
environment, do this on the remote machine. After signing in, open **Settings → Source Control**
and choose **Rescan**.

### GitHub

Install [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) 2.81.0 or newer, then sign in:

```bash
gh auth login
```

### GitLab

Install [GitLab CLI](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli), then sign in:

```bash
glab auth login
```

### Bitbucket

Set an access token in the server's environment:

```bash
export T3CODE_BITBUCKET_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-access-token"
```

Or use an Atlassian account email and API token with read/write access to repositories and pull
requests, plus user read access (`read:user:bitbucket`):

```bash
export T3CODE_BITBUCKET_EMAIL="you@example.com"
export T3CODE_BITBUCKET_API_TOKEN="your-token"
```

The access token takes precedence if both are configured. Restart the server after changing these
variables.

### Azure DevOps

Install [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/), add the DevOps extension, and sign in:

```bash
az extension add --name azure-devops
az login
```

## Clone or publish a project

Use **Add Project** in the command palette (`Cmd/Ctrl+K`) to clone a repository. Choose a hosting
provider or paste a Git URL, then choose where to save it.

For a local Git repository without a remote, **Publish Repository** creates a hosted repository,
adds it as `origin`, and pushes your commits. If there are no commits yet, it creates the remote;
make your first commit before pushing.

## Create a pull request

Use a thread's Git actions to commit, push, and create a pull request. T3 Code can generate commit
messages, review titles, and descriptions from your changes.

Choose the writing style and model in **Settings → Source Control**. **Repository conventions**
uses the project's instructions and recent commit subjects.

## Review and merge

Open **Pull requests** to review changes and comments, request reviewers, check out a branch,
or merge. You can edit review titles and descriptions and your own comments where the host allows it.
GitLab calls these merge requests.

GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps support auto-merge while checks are outstanding. GitHub also
supports approving waiting fork workflows and opening a revert pull request for a merged change.

For Azure DevOps, use the host website to view diffs or change comments. Bitbucket does not support
reopening a declined pull request.

## Manage thread worktrees

Open **Settings → Source Control → Worktrees** to see the Git worktrees managed by T3 Code.
Worktrees are grouped by project. Each row shows its branch, a linked thread, recent activity, and
whether local work protects it from cleanup. Select an available thread title to return to that
conversation.

T3 Code only performs automatic cleanup when a worktree has no active thread, no local changes, and
no unpushed commits. Removing a safe worktree keeps its local branch and T3 checkpoint history. If a
thread needs that worktree again, T3 Code recreates it from the retained branch before starting the
next turn.

**Auto-remove after** sets how long an unused safe worktree is kept. Enable **Remove with last
thread** to remove a safe worktree as soon as its last linked thread is deleted instead of waiting
out that period. Protected worktrees remain listed for you to inspect; T3 Code never automatically
removes dirty or unpushed worktrees. A detached worktree counts as unpushed until its commit is on
the default branch.

## Troubleshooting

- **Not authenticated:** run the provider's login command on the server, then rescan. For Bitbucket,
  confirm the running server received the environment variables.
- **GitHub sign-in cannot be verified:** update GitHub CLI to at least 2.81.0.
- **Push fails despite a connected account:** check the Git remote's credentials. SSH and HTTPS
  remotes can require separate setup from the hosting provider's API access.
- **A review cannot load:** open it on the host website while resolving connectivity, permissions,
  or rate limits.
