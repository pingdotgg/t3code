# Terminal history

Each terminal keeps up to 5,000 lines and 8 MiB of scrollback on its environment
server. T3 Code removes the oldest output when either limit is reached. A long
line can be shortened at the start. New terminal output is not truncated.

These limits apply when you reconnect and when T3 Code restores saved terminal
history. A client can show less scrollback than the server keeps.

On web and desktop, use Shift+PageUp and Shift+PageDown to read scrollback
without leaving terminal input. Ctrl+Shift+Home and Ctrl+Shift+End jump to the
start and latest output; use Cmd instead of Ctrl on macOS. Full-screen terminal
programs keep these navigation keys.

To copy all retained output, choose Select all in the terminal's context menu,
then copy. Cmd+A on macOS and Ctrl+Shift+A elsewhere select the same output.
Ctrl+A still moves to the beginning of shell input on Windows and Linux.
Jump to latest in the context menu returns to the current output.

While a terminal is focused, use `Cmd+]` for the next terminal and `Cmd+[` for
the previous one. On Windows and Linux, use `Ctrl+Alt+]` and `Ctrl+Alt+[`. Cycling wraps
through tabs and split panes in the focused drawer or right panel. Rebind these
shortcuts in Settings > Keybindings.

## fish

T3 Code starts fish with `no-query-term`, avoiding startup waits for terminal
replies. This disables optional fish features that depend on those replies.
T3 Code's exported `fish_features` also hides any universal flags you set with
`set -U fish_features`.

To preserve those flags or enable queries with `query-term`, include them in
`fish_features` in the environment that launches T3 Code. A shell export applies
when you launch T3 Code from that shell; it does not configure a desktop app
launched from the Dock or Finder. Enabling queries can restore the startup wait.
