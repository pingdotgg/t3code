# Architecture

T3 Code keeps execution in the environment that owns the workspace. Web, desktop, and mobile
clients control it over authenticated RPC. A remote client must never substitute its own filesystem,
provider credentials, or machine state for the environment's. The desktop app bundles a server,
but its renderer follows the same boundary.

## Ownership boundaries

Provider processes, terminals, Git, and project files belong to the server. Shared connection and
domain state belongs in `packages/client-runtime`; clients supply platform services and UI.
Keeping that logic shared prevents reconnect and multi-environment behavior from diverging between
web and mobile. See [connection runtime](./connection-runtime.md) and
[remote environments](./remote.md).

The [RPC contract](../../packages/contracts/src/rpc.ts) is the boundary between independently
versioned clients and servers. Subscriptions send the state a client needs, so a client viewing one
thread does not pay for every thread's history. Authentication of a socket does not authorize every
method on it. See [environment auth](./environment-auth.md).

Provider-specific behavior belongs behind an adapter. Orchestration works with normalized commands
and events, so adding a provider should not require branches throughout the domain or clients.
See [provider constraints](./providers.md).

## Durable intent and side effects

The event log is the source of truth for orchestration state. The
[engine](../../apps/server/src/orchestration/Layers/OrchestrationEngine.ts) serializes commands;
the [decider](../../apps/server/src/orchestration/decider.ts) produces events without performing
provider or filesystem work. Events, persisted projections, and the accepted command receipt commit
in one database transaction. The in-memory state changes and subscribers receive events after that
commit. This keeps command retries idempotent and prevents a persisted projection from getting
ahead of the event log.

Reactors perform side effects after intent has been recorded, then feed results back through
commands. A command acknowledgement therefore means the intent committed, not that the provider,
checkpoint, or other follow-up work finished. Keep external I/O out of the decider and the database
transaction.

Persisted events must remain decodable on replay. Changing a schema affects old environments at
startup as well as live RPC traffic. Compatibility work must account for stored history, not just
what the newest client sends.

## Turn completion and checkpoints

A turn ending and its follow-up work settling are separate milestones. The
[projector](../../apps/server/src/orchestration/projector.ts) settles the turn from its session
status. A late checkpoint or diff must not extend the recorded turn duration or keep the client
showing provider work as active.

[Checkpoints](../../apps/server/src/checkpointing/CheckpointStore.ts) use hidden Git refs to
capture workspace state without adding commits to the user's branch. A revert must coordinate
workspace state with the provider conversation. A provider that cannot roll back its conversation
must reject that operation before changing the filesystem.

## Waiting for asynchronous work

Tests use [drainable workers](../../packages/shared/src/DrainableWorker.ts) to wait until both the
queue and its current item have finished. An empty queue alone does not prove the worker is idle.

Runtime receipts mark specific test milestones. Their
[production layer](../../apps/server/src/orchestration/Layers/RuntimeReceiptBus.ts) is a no-op;
production behavior must use persisted state and events. These test signals are separate from the
durable command receipts that make dispatch idempotent.

See the [glossary](./glossary.md) for shared terms and the
[development runbook](../operations/development.md) for setup and checks.
