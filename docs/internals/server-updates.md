# Server updates

A [stable launcher](../../apps/server/src/serviceLauncher.ts) owns the runtime
selected by systemd or launchd. It is the only runtime writer of durable service
state. Server children request updates over inherited IPC; they never rewrite
their service definition or select their own replacement. Local service commands
may replace the launcher and state while the service is stopped. Foreground CLI
processes do not self-update.

Exact-version installs keep restarts independent of npm cache eviction or a moving
release tag. Installation and preflight happen in staging before publishing an
immutable runtime. Preflight checks the launcher protocol because a target that
needs new rollback guarantees cannot safely run under an older launcher. Upgrading
that launcher requires a local service update.

## Server ownership

[Server ownership](../../apps/server/src/serverOwnership.ts) is shared by server
startup, service setup, and SSH launch. The resolved state directory defines
ownership, so symlink aliases cannot create separate owners. The server holds
an OS lock through shutdown. Never delete or replace `server-owner.sqlite`,
including during rollback. Replacing the file would let another server lock a
different file while the first still runs. A crash releases the lock automatically.

Older releases do not honor this lock. A legacy record with a live PID blocks
startup unless its process start time proves PID reuse. An unknown start time
keeps the refusal in place. PID existence never authorizes a stop. Service setup
requires an explicit stop of unmanaged servers rather than terminating active
agent work.

## Commit boundary

The launcher durably records the pending update before acknowledging it, then
stops the old child and starts the target as a trial. Service-state writes use
same-directory replacement with file and directory fsync. Invalid state stops
startup rather than guessing which runtime to boot.

The trial must finish migrations, acquire dependencies, bind HTTP, and park every
long-running root at the activation gate before reporting `prepared`. The launcher
then commits the target version durably and replies `committed`. Only then may the
child release its gates, accept commands, and publish ready. Keep fallible startup
acquisitions before this boundary. A listener alone does not prove the runtime is
ready to commit.

A failed or timed-out trial returns to the old version. After commit, the target
is authoritative and the service manager's ordinary restart policy applies.

## Database rollback

After the old child exits, the launcher snapshots SQLite's main file, WAL, and
shared-memory file. This makes trial migrations reversible without down
migrations. The snapshot is made once per update and survives launcher restarts;
replacing it during a retry could capture changes from the failed trial.

Rollback stops the trial before restoring. A durable restore marker makes an
interrupted restore finish before either version boots. Keep the snapshot until
commit, or until both restoration and the terminal rollback state are durable.
Attachments and other files outside SQLite are outside this rollback boundary.

Backup and restore hold the same state-directory lock as the server children.
This excludes another current-version server while database files change, but
does not reserve ownership between children. A retained pending update can still
restore its snapshot after an intervening owner exits.

## Client acknowledgement

An accepted update is still pending. Clients correlate the launcher's update ID
with the ready event after reconnecting, then check the outcome and target version.
A reconnect alone cannot distinguish successful replacement from rollback. Older
servers without an update ID retain version-only correlation.

Desktop updates have a separate two-phase handoff because installing the app stops
its bundled backend. Preparation returns a token while the connection is alive;
the client commits that token only after receiving it. Otherwise backend shutdown
could lose the only successful RPC result. The client must then observe the
prepared version after reconnecting. If installation fails, desktop restarts the
stopped backends and replays the failure for the same token.
