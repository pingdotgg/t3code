 * its own runtime and interaction modes, an outside client the ceiling it was
 * approved with. Nothing a caller starts or changes may run with broader
 * modes, and a thread caller changes things only while its own run is live.
 * A refusal is an `OrchestratorMcpFailure`, so the compiler requires it in the
 * tool's failure schema, and `ThreadManagementService` in its dependencies.
