/**
 * ProviderInstanceRegistryHydration — derive a `ProviderInstanceConfigMap`
 * from `ServerSettings` and keep `ProviderInstanceRegistry` in sync with it.
 *
 * The server still reads two shapes:
 *
 *   1. `settings.providerInstances` — the new driver-agnostic map the
 *      registry expects. Keyed by `ProviderInstanceId`, values are
 *      `ProviderInstanceConfig` envelopes.
 *   2. `settings.providers.<kind>` — the legacy single-instance-per-driver
 *      fields (`providers.codex`, `providers.claudeAgent`, …). These are
 *      the source of truth for every deployment that hasn't been migrated
 *      yet to an explicit `providerInstances` entry.
 *
 * This module bridges (2) into (1) and wires the resulting map into a
 * mutable registry. For every built-in driver whose id is not already
 * present in `providerInstances` (keyed on
 * `defaultInstanceIdForDriver(driverKind)` — literally the driver kind as a
 * routing slug), we synthesize an envelope from the legacy field. The
 * registry decodes both flavours through the same `configSchema` and ends
 * up with one uniform `ProviderInstance` per entry.
 *
 * Explicit `providerInstances` entries always win — users can already
 * override the legacy `providers.<kind>` blob by authoring a
 * `providerInstances.codex` entry with a matching driver, and we don't
 * want the synthesized envelope to silently stomp their config.
 *
 * Hot-reload
 * ----------
 * On layer build we:
 *   1. Subscribe to settings changes, then read the current
 *      `ServerSettings` once and use it to seed the
 *      registry's initial state via `ProviderInstanceRegistryMutableLayer`.
 *   2. Fork a daemon fiber (lifetime tied to the layer's scope) that
 *      subscribes to `ServerSettingsService.streamChanges` and calls
 *      `ProviderInstanceRegistryMutator.reconcile` on every emission.
 *   3. Once Windows profile hydration completes, refresh provider health
 *      snapshots in place. PATH hydration does not change provider config,
 *      so it must not replace adapters or interrupt their active turns.
 *
 * Failures inside the watcher are logged and swallowed so a single bad
 * settings emission cannot kill the registry. Unknown drivers and invalid
 * configs already round-trip through the registry's own "unavailable"
 * shadow bucket.
