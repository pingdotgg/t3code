/**
 * Guided reviews: a maintainer-facing brief on a pull request, written by the environment's
 * source-control writer model. See `PullRequestReviewGuide` in contracts for what a guide is for.
 *
 * The model reads the change itself, read-only, from a disposable checkout of the head, so a
 * guide has no size limit. That takes minutes on a large change, so a run belongs to the server
 * rather than to the request that started it: Generate returns as soon as the run is under way
 * and readers watch its state through `get`.
 *
 * Generation is explicit and the result is stored per pull request, so opening a guide never
 * spends a model run. A push leaves the stored guide in place and the reader sees it as stale.
