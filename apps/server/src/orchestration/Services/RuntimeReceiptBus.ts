/**
 * RuntimeReceiptBus - Internal checkpoint-reactor synchronization receipts.
 *
 * This service exists to expose short-lived orchestration milestones that are
 * useful in tests and harnesses but are not part of the production runtime
 * event model. `CheckpointReactor` publishes receipts such as baseline capture,
 * diff finalization, and turn-processing quiescence so integration tests can
 * wait for those exact points without inferring them indirectly from persisted
 * state.
 *
 * Production code should only call `publish`. Test code may subscribe via
 * `streamEventsForTest`, which is intentionally named to make the intended
 * usage explicit.
 *
 * @module RuntimeReceiptBus
