 * A guided review is written for the maintainer deciding whether a change should land, not for
 * someone checking it line by line. Review agents already read every line; what is left for a
 * person is intent, design, and the calls an agent cannot make on their behalf.
 *
 * So a guide is a tour of stops in reading order, each building on the ones before (contract, then
 * the service, then its callers), with the mechanical rest grouped at the end. Each stop shows only
 * the code that carries its idea and names the one call a maintainer should make there, if any;
 * that call is what tells the reader where to slow down.
 *
 * The model writes the tour; the server holds it to the change. Excerpts and notes are clamped to
 * lines the change touched, and a changed file the model left out still lands in a closing skim
 * stop, so every file is accounted for.
