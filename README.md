## If you REALLY want to contribute still.... read this first

Before local development, prepare the environment and install dependencies:

```bash
# Optional: only needed if you use mise for dev tool management.
mise install
vp install
```

T3 Cloud is optional and disabled in a fresh clone. To enable it for web, desktop, and mobile source
builds, copy [`.env.example`](./.env.example) to `.env` at the repository root and set the canonical
public configuration there.
